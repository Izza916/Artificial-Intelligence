Initial Population (set of solutions) = 6 Fitness (Quality of solution) = each solution is generally represented as a string of binary numbers, known as a chromosome. The most common fitness function for TSP is the length of the route. However, the 'shorter' the route is - the better. Crossover point, exchange data after ‘1’ instances of the list. Mutation point perform between 2nd and 4th item.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4L1r3BUHDLZ2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import random as rand\n","import copy\n","class City:\n","    def __init__(self, name, x_coord, y_coord):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.x_coord = x_coord\n","        self.y_coord = y_coord\n","    def __str__(self):\n","        return f\"City(name='{self.name}', x_coord={self.x_coord}, y_coord={self.y_coord})\"\n","def calculate_distance(city1, city2):\n","    return ((city1.x_coord - city2.x_coord) ** 2 + (city1.y_coord - city2.y_coord) ** 2) ** 0.5\n","def calculate_fitness(route):\n","    total_distance = 0\n","    for i in range(len(route) - 1):\n","        total_distance += calculate_distance(route[i], route[i + 1])\n","    total_distance += calculate_distance(route[-1], route[0])\n","    return 1 / total_distance\n","def perform_crossover(parent1, parent2, crossover_point):\n","    child = parent1[:crossover_point] + parent2[crossover_point:]\n","    return child\n","def perform_mutation(route, mutation_rate):\n","    if rand.random() < mutation_rate:\n","        i, j = rand.sample(range(1, len(route) - 1), 2)\n","        route[i], route[j] = route[j], route[i]\n","def select_parent(population, fitness_function):\n","    weights = [fitness_function(individual) for individual in population]\n","    total_weight = sum(weights)\n","    spin = rand.random() * total_weight\n","    partial_sum = 0\n","    for individual, weight in zip(population, weights):\n","        partial_sum += weight\n","        if partial_sum >= spin:\n","            return individual\n","def genetic_algorithm(cities, population_size, generations, crossover_rate, mutation_rate):\n","    population = []\n","    for _ in range(population_size):\n","        rand.shuffle(cities)\n","        population.append(copy.deepcopy(cities))\n","    for _ in range(generations):\n","        new_population = []\n","        for _ in range(int(population_size / 2)):\n","            parent1 = select_parent(population, calculate_fitness)\n","            parent2 = select_parent(population, calculate_fitness)\n","            if rand.random() < crossover_rate:\n","                crossover_point = rand.randint(1, len(parent1) - 2)\n","                child = perform_crossover(parent1, parent2, crossover_point)\n","            else:\n","                child = parent1.copy()\n","            perform_mutation(child, mutation_rate)\n","            new_population.append(child)\n","        population = new_population\n","    best_route = max(population, key=calculate_fitness)\n","    best_distance = 1 / calculate_fitness(best_route)\n","    return best_route, best_distance\n","cities = [City(\"A\", 0, 0), City(\"B\", 1, 2), City(\"C\", 3, 1), City(\"D\", 2, 4)]\n","population_size = 10\n","generations = 50\n","crossover_rate = 0.8\n","mutation_rate = 0.1\n","best_route, best_distance = genetic_algorithm(cities, population_size, generations, crossover_rate, mutation_rate)\n","best_route_names = \", \".join(str(city) for city in best_route)\n","print(f\"Best route: {best_route_names}\")\n","print(f\"Best distance: {best_distance}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"KjtQKsEhCTNn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710958090746,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"k224120 Izza Farhat","userId":"10701324734490980400"}},"outputId":"fbf53b19-e14e-43e5-a2b6-c3ca7c936c4b"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Best route: City(name='B', x_coord=1, y_coord=2), City(name='C', x_coord=3, y_coord=1), City(name='C', x_coord=3, y_coord=1), City(name='A', x_coord=0, y_coord=0)\n","Best distance: 7.63441361516796\n"]}]}]}
